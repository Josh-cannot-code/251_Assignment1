## Description:
You are given a class called BST, your job is to implement a
new class called "RBTree" which extends BST. A template for 
this class has been provided but you may add methods an properties
is you see fit. On the given RBTree skeleton, a property "nil" is 
defined. Please use this for any external node in the tree as 
seen in class. There is also an Color enum file. You must use
this enum as the color property for the nodes in your RBTree.

## Questions:
- Should we give them the template file?
- Should we ask them to provide a check validity implementation?
