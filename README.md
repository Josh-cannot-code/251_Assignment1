## Description:
You are given an abstract class called RBTree, your job is to implement
a new class called "MyRBTree" which extends RBTree. A template for 
this class has been provided, but you may add helper methods as 
you see fit, just make sure they are only visible to the class.


## Constraints:
- Initialize root to the provided nil property on RBTree and 
use nil for all external nodes and parent of root.
- Use the provided Color enum for the color property on nodes.


## Assumptions:
- We will not add a number that already exists in the tree

## Reminders:
- Check edge cases, they will not be in the public tests
 but may be checked in private tests.
