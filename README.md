## Description:
You are given a class called BST, your job is to implement a
new class called "RBTree" which extends BST. A template for 
this class has been provided but you may add methods an properties
is you see fit. On the given RBTree skeleton, a property "nil" is 
defined. Please use this for any external node in the tree as 
seen in class. There is also an Color enum file. You must use
this enum as the color property for the nodes in your RBTree.

## Constraints:
- Initialize root to nil, use nil for all external nodes and parent of root


## Questions:
- Should we give them the template file?
- Should we ask them to provide a check validity implementation?

## Assumptions:
- We will not add a number that already exists in the tree

## Reminders:
- Check edge cases, they will not be in the public tests
 but will be included in private tests
